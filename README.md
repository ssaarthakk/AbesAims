# Running the App Locally

This README will guide you through the steps to run an Expo app on your local machine. Before starting, ensure that you have **Node.js** and **Expo Go** installed on your devices. 

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure Node.js is installed on your computer. You can download it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Expo Go**: Install the Expo Go app on your mobile device from the App Store (iOS) or Google Play Store (Android).

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the project repository to your local machine. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ssaarthakk/AbesAims.git
cd https://github.com/ssaarthakk/AbesAims.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Inside the project folder, run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start the Expo Development Server

To start the Expo development server, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This command will start the development server and provide a QR code to launch the app in your mobile device.

### 4. Open the App on Your Mobile Device

1. Open the **Expo Go** app on your mobile device.
2. Scan the QR code directly from your terminal if it appears there.

> **Note**: Ensure that your mobile device and development computer are on the same Wi-Fi network to allow the app to load on your device.

### Troubleshooting

- **App Not Loading**: Check if your computer and mobile device are on the same network. If the problem persists, restart your wifi router and try again.
- **Expo Go App Crashes**: Restart the Expo development server by closing the terminal and rerunning `npx expo start`.


## Why Did I build this?

I came across two sites [First](https://aims-abes.vercel.app/), [Second](https://simpsimp.netlify.app/) made by two of my seniors and I was just impressed by how did they get acess to that data, I reverse engineered these two sites a little and got access to the apis used by Simplifii so I thought I wanted to build something similar, but there were already two websites, so I thought why not an app? And Here it is.

The design is highly insipred (rather copied) by these two website (mainly because I'm horrendous at design) and I want to apologize about copying their design (I really am sorry).
